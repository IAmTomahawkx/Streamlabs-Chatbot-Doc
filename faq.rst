Where'd My Scripts Tab Go????
------------------------------
This is probably the most frequently asked question we get.
The :ref:`scripts <scripts>` tab only shows up if you have valid Streamer/ Bot account tokens. If your :ref:`scripts <scripts>` isn't showing up,
it most likely means your token(s) are invalid. Go to Settings (gear icon, bottom left) > Streamer/Bot > Generate Token >
Connect. That should solve the case of the disappearing tab

Songrequest links
---------------------
The default setting for :ref:`Song Requests <song-requests>` allows for only direct youtube links. you can change this by going into the
:ref:`Song Requests <song-requests>` settings, changing the *mode* from **$id** to either of the **$readapi** options. Now you should be able to
request songs by name.
