Where'd My Scripts Tab Go????
------------------------------
This is probably the most frequently asked question we get.
The :ref:`scripts` tab only shows up if you have valid Streamer/ Bot account tokens. If your :ref:`scripts` isn't showing up,
it most likely means your token(s) are invalid. Go to Settings (gear icon, bottom left) > Streamer/Bot > Generate Token >
Connect. That should solve the case of the dissapearing tab
