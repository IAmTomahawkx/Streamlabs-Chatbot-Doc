Where'd My Scripts Tab Go????
------------------------------
This is probably the most frequently asked question we get.
The :ref:`scripts` tab only shows up if you have valid Streamer/ Bot account tokens. If your :ref:`scripts` isn't showing up,
it most likely means your token(s) are invalid. Go to Settings (gear icon, bottom left) > Streamer/Bot > Generate Token >
Connect. That should solve the case of the dissapearing tab

Songrequest links
---------------------
The default setting for :ref:`songrequests` allows for only direct youtube links. you can change this by going into the
songrequests settings, changing the *mode* from **$id** to either of the **$readapi** options. Now you should be able to
request songs by name.

Bot not responding
---------------------
Your tokens are probably expired. Regenerate them by going to Connections (bottom left of the bot) > Streamer account > generate token > connect.
repeat for the bot account.


Local and extension currency. What's the difference?
------------------------------------------------------
The local currency is stored directly in the bot, and allows for more customization.
The extension currency is stored in the cloud, and syncs to the streamlabs currency. this does not allow as much customization.
