   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the Streamlabs Chatbot documentation
===============================================
I (IAmTomahawkx) would like to alert you that this is *not* the Official Streamlabc Chatbot Documentation.
I made this documentation so i could point people at a specific part of the documentation, instead of simply pointing
at the documentation link and saying "figure it out". Also because I figured the docs were due for an update.
Any efforts to improve this documentation can be sent to me on discord,
or emailed to me at iamtomahawkx@gmail.com . Preferably don't add a pull request to the github repo, as i rarely look at github :P

Although these docs are mostly taken from the original documentation,
if you would like the official documentation, it can be seen `Here <https://cdn.streamlabs.com/chatbot/Documentation_Twitch.pdf>`_.

Another note: this documentation is all designed
with Twitch in mind. if you stream on Youtube or Mixer, you'll need to use the other docs until i finish those platforms
(soonâ„¢). Sorry!
